\arguments{
\item{data_raw}{Time series data to fit model}

\item{data_raw_pg}{Time series of primigravidae ANC data to fit model}

\item{data_raw_mg}{Time series of multigravidae ANC data to fit model}

\item{init_EIR}{A single value or a dataframe with two columns (time and EIR)
to specify historical malaria transmission levels before
data collection began.}

\item{target_prev}{Return an initial EIR value (from the equilibrium solution),
given a target prevalence in under 5yos or 2 to 10 year olds}

\item{target_prev_group}{Age group used for target prevalence ('u5' or '2to10')}

\item{n_particles}{Number of particles to be used in pMCMC (default = 200)}

\item{proposal_matrix}{Proposal matrix for MCMC parameters}

\item{max_param}{Ceiling for proposed stochastic parameter (either EIR or betaa) values (default = 1000)}

\item{prop_treated}{Proportion of clinical cases that receive effective treatment (default = 40\%)}

\item{n_steps}{Number of MCMC steps in a single chain (default = 500)}

\item{n_threads}{Number of processing threads (default = 4)}

\item{n_chains}{Number of chains (default = 1)}

\item{n_workers}{Number of workers (default = 4)}

\item{state_check}{If state_check = TRUE, returns expected deriv values which should equal 0 and sets stochastic model to have EIR constant at init_EIR
If state_check = TRUE and seasonality_on = 1, then the deterministic seasonal model is still run, but theta2 is forced to 1, forcing a constant seasonality profile
If state_check = FALSE, no values are printed}

\item{country}{Name of country (needed if using seasonality model)}

\item{admin_unit}{Name of administrative unit (needed if using seasonality model)}

\item{seasonality_on}{Toggle seasonality model run before observed time period (default = 1)}

\item{seasonality_check}{Toggle saving values of seasonality equilibrium (default = 1)}

\item{check_flexibility}{Toggle saving values of flexibility period}

\item{seed}{Allows user to specify a seed (default = 1L)}

\item{start_pf_time}{Number of days before first observation that particle filter will start (default = 30)}

\item{particle_tune}{Logical to determine if tuning the number of particles should be performed.}

\item{comparison}{The comparison function to be used. Either 'u5' which
equates the observed prevalence to prevalence under 5 years old in
the model or 'pgmg' which calculates prevalence in primigravid and
multigravid pregnant women for comparison with observed ANC data. c('u5','pg','sg','mg','pgmg','pgsg','ancall')
If in a format XtoY, where X and Y are two numbers, will compare to general population between those two ages.}

\item{initial}{Is the initial equilibrium state informed by the user ('user-informed') or by the observed data ('fitted')?}

This function sets up and runs a particle MCMC that uses Dust, Odin and MCState
